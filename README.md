# Personal P&L
**A Opinionated Open Source Operating System For Your Personal Finances**

## Backstory
For the past 5 years I have managed my personal finances in the same way I would manage the personal finances of a company. I have a very complicated Excel Sheet to track a Profit & Loss statement to run my personal finances like a company.

P&L are the gold standard for managing and tracking a companys finances why not take the same ideas and bring them over to personal finance. 

We're now creating the product as a fully open-source project. The goal is to let you run the app yourself, for free, and use it to manage your own finances and eventually offer a hosted version of the app for a small monthly fee.

## Hosting
